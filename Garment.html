                 <p>
                  Coal used for heating one's home was
                  scarce and often expensive, so people often
                  wore clothing with extra silk-floss and fur-lined
                  coats in the winter.The clothing material
                  preferred by the rich was silk, and for special
                  occasions they had silk robes with gold brocade.
                  The clothing material used by the poor was often hempen
                  cloth, but cotton clothes were also used, the latter being
                  most widely available in the south.The types of clothes
                  worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform
                  in appearance (with color standard of black and white),
                  and so was the case for the upper class and elite.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In fact, wealthy and leading members of society
                  followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for
                  clothing. In the upper class, each stratified grade in the
                  social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and
                  specific ornamentation of robes, the shape and type of
                  headgear, and even the style of girdle worn.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the
                  dynasty. However, the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur
                  as the color purple, once reserved solely for the attire of third
                  rank officials or higher, began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials
                  who bore the color indiscriminately. Along with lower grade civil
                  officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire,
                  the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration
                  of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society.
                  Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the
                  class of rich merchants and business owners; the officials were distinguished
                  by their long robes reaching to the ground, while merchants often wore
                  a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers. Pants and
                  trousers were introduced to China during the Warring States in the 4th century BC,
                  and were not exclusive to merchants; every soldier wore trousers as part of
                  his uniform, while trousers were also worn by the common people. Although
                  most men were cleanshaven, soldiers, military officers, and professional boxing
                  champions preferred side-whiskers and goatee beards, a
                  s they were a sign of virility.</p>
                  <p>
                   The attire of Song women was distinguished
                   from men's clothing by being fastened on the left,
                   not on the right.Women wore long dresses or blouses
                   that came down almost to the knee. They also wore skirts
                   and jackets with short or long sleeves. When strolling about
                   outside and along the road, women of wealthy means chose to wear
                   square purple scarves around their shoulders. Ladies also wore
                   hairpins and combs in their hair, while princesses, imperial concubines,
                   and the wives of officials and wealthy merchants wore head ornaments
                   of gold and silver that were shaped in the form of phoenixes and flowers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People in the Song dynasty never
                    left their homes barefoot, and always
                    had some sort of headgear on. Shops
                    in the city specialized in certain types of hats and
                    headgear, including caps with pointed tails, as well as
                    belts and waistwraps. Only Buddhist monks shaved their
                    heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort
                    to cover their heads. For footwear, people could purchase
                    leather shoes called 'oiled footwear', wooden sandals, hempen
                    sandals, and the more expensive satin slippers.
