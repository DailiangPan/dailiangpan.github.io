                  Many of the peculiar names for these
                  dishes do not provide clues as to what
                  types of food ingredients were used.
                  However, judging from the listed seasonings
                  they used for these dishes, such as pepper,
                  ginger, soya sauce, oil, salt, and vinegar,
                  Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different
                  from the Chinese cuisine of today. Other
                  additional seasonings and ingredients included
                  walnuts, turnips, crushed Chinese cardamon kernels,
                  fagara, olives, ginkgo nuts, citrus zest, and sesame oil
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Regional differences in culture brought about
                  different types of foods, while in certain areas
                  the cooking traditions of regional cultures blended
                  together; such was the case of the Southern Song capital
                  at Hangzhou. After the mass exodus from the north,
                  people brought Henan-style cooking and foods
                  (popular in the previous Northern Song capital at Kaifeng)
                  to Hangzhou, which was blended with the cooking traditions
                  of Zhejiang. However, records indicate that already in
                  the Northern Song period, the first capital at Kaifeng sported
                  restaurants that served southern Chinese cuisine. This
                  catered to capital officials whose native provinces were in the
                  southeast, and would have found northern cuisine lacking in
                  sufficient seasoning for their tastes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In fact, texts from the Song era provide the
                  first use of the phrases nanshi, beishi, and
                  chuanfan to refer specifically to northern, southern,
                  and Sichuan cooking, respectively. Many restaurants
                  were known for their specialties; for example, there was
                  one restaurant in Hangzhou that served only iced foods,
                  while some restaurants catered to those who wanted either hot,
                  warm, room temperature, or cold foods. Descendants of those
                  from Kaifeng owned most of the restaurants found in Hangzhou,
                  but many other regional varieties in foodstuffs and cooking were
                  sponsored by restaurants. This included restaurants catering Sichuan
                  cuisine that emphasized use of pepper, dishes and beverages
                  from Hebei and Shandong, and coastal foods of shrimp and saltwater
                  fish. The memory and patience of waiters had to be keen; in the
                  larger restaurants, serving dinner parties that required twenty or so
                  dishes became a hassle if even a slight error occurred. If a guest
                  reported the mistake of a waiter to the head of the restaurant, the
                  waiter could be verbally reprimanded, have his salary docked, or in
                  extreme cases, kicked out of the establishment for good.</p>
                  <p>
                   In the early morning in Hangzhou, along
                   the wide avenue of the Imperial Way,
                   special breakfast items and delicacies were sold.
                   This included fried tripe, pieces of mutton or
                   goose, soups of various kinds, hot pancakes, steamed
                   pancakes, and iced cakes.Noodle shops were also
                   popular, and remained open all day and night along the
                   Imperial Way. According to one Song source on Kaifeng,
                   the night markets closed at the third night watch but reopened
                   on the fifth, while they had also gained a reputation for
                   staying open during winter storms and the darkest, rainiest days of winter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There were also some exotic foreign
                   foods imported to China from abroad,
                   including raisins, dates, Persian jujubes,
                   and grape wine; rice wine was more common in
                   China, a fact noted even by the 13th century
                   Venetian traveler Marco Polo. Although grape-based
                   wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty
                   Chinese ventured into Hellenistic Central Asia,
                   grape-wine was often reserved for the elite.
                   Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice,
                   lychee fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice.

                  <p>
                   Dairy products and farming were
                   foreign concepts to the Chinese, which explains
                   the absence of cheese and milk in their diet.
                   Beef was also rarely eaten, since the bull was an
                   important draft animal. The main diet of the lower
                   classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish, while it is
                   known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes
                   did not eat dog meat. The rich are known to have consumed
                   an array of different meats, such as chicken, shellfish, fallow
                   deer, hares, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam,
                   crab, and many others.Local freshwater fish from the nearby
                   lake and river were also caught and brought to market, while
                   the West Lake provided geese and duck as well.</p>
                    <p>
                     Common fruits that were consumed included
                     melons, pomegranates, lychees, longans, golden oranges,
                     jujubes, Chinese and Japanese quinces, apricots and pears; in
                     the region around Hangzhou alone, there were eleven kinds of apricots
                     and eight different kinds of pears that were produced.
                     Specialties and combination dishes in the Song period included scented
                     shellfish cooked in rice-wine, geese with apricots, lotus-seed soup,
                     spicy soup with mussels and fish cooked with plums, sweet soya soup, baked
                     sesame buns stuffed with either sour bean filling or pork tenderloin,
                     mixed vegetable buns, fragrant candied fruit, strips of ginger and
                     fermented beanpaste, jujube-stuffed steamed dumplings,
                     fried chestnuts, salted fermented bean soup, fruit cooked
                     in scented honey, and 'honey crisps' of kneaded and baked
                     honey, flour, mutton fat and pork lard.
                     Dessert molds of oiled flour and sugared honey were shaped
                     into girls' faces or statuettes of soldiers with full armor
                     like door guards, and were called "likeness foods" (guoshi).
