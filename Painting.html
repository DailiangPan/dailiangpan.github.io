                  The shan shui style painting—"shan"
                  meaning mountain, and "shui" meaning river—became
                  prominent features in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis
                  laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded
                  in Chinese philosophy; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny
                  specks amongst vast and greater cosmos, while Neo-Confucianist writers
                  often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed
                  caused all social and natural phenomena.

                  The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and
                  celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also
                  developed further during the Song period. Longquan
                  celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period.
                  Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully
                  carved artwork of miniature nature scenes, landscapes, or simple
                  decorative motifs. However, even though intricate bronze-casting, ceramics
                  and lacquerware, jade carving, sculpture, architecture, and the painting of
                  portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high
                  esteem by the Song Chinese, landscape painting was paramount. By the beginning
                  of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged. Artists mastered
                  the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while
                  the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out
                  of high clouds and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.

                  There was a significant difference in painting
                  trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and
                  Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song
                  officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order
                  to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of
                  their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes.
                  On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming
                  society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed
                  had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller,
                  visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background
                  was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern
                  for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next
                  stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to
                  Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down,
                  which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the
                  Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled
                  academies seen in the Northern Song era.</p>
                  <p>
                  Ever since the Southern and Northern Dynasties
                  (420–589), painting had become an art of high sophistication
                  that was associated with the gentry class as one of
                  their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy
                  and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art
                  collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their
                  own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and
                  friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his
                  accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs,
                  borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really
                  admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. The
                  small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often
                  collected into albums as poets would write poems along the
                  side to match the theme and mood of the painting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There were also some exotic foreign
                   foods imported to China from abroad,
                   including raisins, dates, Persian jujubes,
                   and grape wine; rice wine was more common in
                   China, a fact noted even by the 13th century
                   Venetian traveler Marco Polo. Although grape-based
                   wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty
                   Chinese ventured into Hellenistic Central Asia,
                   grape-wine was often reserved for the elite.
                   Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice,
                   lychee fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice.

                   However, during the Song period, there were many acclaimed court
                   painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal
                   family. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by
                   the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145), who painted the original
                   Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll, one of the most well-known
                   masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) once
                   commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of
                   a Nomad Flute, based on the woman poet Cai Wenji (177–250 AD) of the earlier
                   Han dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian
                   (趙孟堅, c. 1199–1264), a member of the Imperial family,
                   known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter.</p>
                  <p>
                   During the Song period Buddhism saw a small
                   revival since its persecution during the Tang
                   dynasty. This could be seen in the continued construction
                   of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province.
                   Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu, the Song temple at
                   Mingshan in Anyue, Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era
                   Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities
                   clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes.
