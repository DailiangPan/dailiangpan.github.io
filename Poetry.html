                  Although the earlier Tang dynasty is viewed as the zenith era
                  for Chinese poetry (particularly the shi style poetry of Du Fu, Li Bai, Bai Juyi),
                  there were important poetic developments by famous poets of the Song era, with the
                  flourishing of the ci form being especially being associated with Song poetry. Song
                  developments in poetry included the works of the social critic and pioneer of the
                  "new subjective style" Mei Yaochen (1002–1060), the politically controversial yet
                  renowned master Su Shi (1037–1101), the eccentric yet brilliant Mi Fu (1051–1107),
                  the premier Chinese female poet Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), and many others.
                  Although having roots in the Liang dynasty (502–557 AD), and further development
                  during the brief existence of the Southern Tang immediate preceding the Song,
                  the ci form of Chinese poetry found its greatest acceptance and popularity during
                  the Song dynasty, and was used by most Song poets. The high court Chancellor
                  Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), ardent Neo-Confucian Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), the great
                  calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045–1105), and the military general Xin Qiji (1140–1207)
                  were especially known for their ci poetry, amongst many others. The great ci
                  poet Li Yu (who ruled the Southern Tang under the name Li Houzhu) wrote some
                  of his most famous works during his time as a prisoner at the first Song court,
                  following the demise of his former kingdom: Li Yu is an important transitional
                  igure, sometimes considered to be the first major Song poet,
                  and sometimes acclaimed as the last major Tang poet.

                  Historiography in literature remained
                  prominent during the Song, as it had in
                  previous ages and would in successive ages
                  of China. Along with Song Qi, the essayist and historian
                  Ouyang Xiu were responsible for compiling the New Book of
                  Tang by 1060, covering the history of the Tang dynasty.
                  Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086), the political nemesis
                  of Wang Anshi (1021–1086), was responsible for heading a
                  team of scholars that compiled the enormous historical work
                  of the Zizhi Tongjian, a universal history completed in 1084
                  AD with a total of over 3 million written Chinese characters
                  in 294 volumes. It covered the major themes and intricate
                  nuances of Chinese history from 425 BC during the Warring States
                  all the way up to the 10th century and the fall of the Tang.
                  In 1189 it was compiled and condensed into fifty-nine books by Zhu Xi (1130–1200),
                  while this project was totally complete with the efforts of
                  his disciples around the time of his death in 1200.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There were also very large encyclopedic works written
                  in the Song period, such as the Four Great Books of Song
                  compiled first by Li Fang in the 10th century and fully
                  edited by the time of Cefu Yuangui in the 11th century. The
                  largest of these was the 1013 publication of the Prime Tortoise
                  of the Record Bureau, a massive encyclopedia consisting of 9.4
                  million written Chinese characters divided into 1000 volumes.
                  There were also rhyme dictionaries written during the Song dynasty,
                  such as the Jiyun of 1037. Although Neo-Confucianism became dominant
                  over Buddhism in China during this period, there was still a
                  significant amount of Buddhist literature. For example, there was the
                  collection of Zen Buddhist kōans in the Blue Cliff Record of 1125,
                  which was expanded by Yuanwu Keqin (1063–1135). 'Travel record
                  literature' ('youji wenxue') was also a popular category of literature
                  during the Song period, which was accounts of one's own travel experiences
                  typically written in narrative or prose styles, and included authors such
                  as Fan Chengda (1126–1193).[15] A great example of Chinese travel literature
                  in the Song period would be Su Shi's (1037–1101) Record of Stone Bell Mountain.</p>
                  <p>
                   There were many technical and scientific writings
                   during the Song period. The two most eminent authors of the
                   scientific and technical fields were Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and his
                   contemporary Su Song (1020–1101). Shen Kuo published his Dream Pool
                   Essays in 1088 AD, an enormous encyclopedic book that covered
                   a wide range of subjects, including literature, art, military
                   strategy, mathematics, astronomy, meteorology, geology, geography,
                   metallurgy, engineering, hydraulics, architecture, zoology,
                   botany, agronomy, medicine, anthropology, archeology, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As for Shen Kuo's equally brilliant peer, Su Song created
                   a celestial atlas of five different star maps, wrote the 1070
                   AD pharmaceutical treatise of the Ben Cao Tu Jing (Illustrated Pharmacopoeia),
                   which had the related subjects of botany, zoology, metallurgy,
                   and mineralogy, and wrote his famous horological treatise of the Xin
                   Yi Xiang Fa Yao in 1092 AD, which described in full detail his ingenious
                   astronomical clock tower constructed in the capital city of Kaifeng.
                   Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their
                   field during the time, there were many others. For producing textiles, Qin Guan's
                   book of 1090 AD, the Can Shu (Book of Sericulture), included description of a
                   silk-reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the mechanical
                   belt drive in order to function. In the literary field of agronomy, there was
                   the Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu (The Rescue of the People; a Treatise on Famine Prevention and Relief)
                   edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century, the Cha Lu (Record of Tea) written by Cai Xiang in 1060 AD,
                   the Zhu Zi Cang Fa (Master Zhu on Managing Communal Granaries)
                   written by Zhu Xi in 1182 AD, and many others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There were also great authors of written works
                   pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song,
                   such as Yue Shi (his book in 983), Wang Zhu (in 1051), Li Dechu (in 1080),
                   Chen Kunchen (in 1111), Ouyang Wen (in 1117), and Zhu Mu (in 1240).
                   Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China
                   since the 1st century, the matured form known as "treatise on a place", or
                   fangzhi, replaced the old "map guide", or tujing, under the Song. The major
                   differences between the two were that fangzhi were products of local initiative
                   and decision-making, were typically ten to fifty chapters in length, and were almost
                   always printed for a large audience, whereas tujing were products of infrequent demands
                   from the central government and were typically only four chapters long.
                   The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people
                   to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts, such as
                   printed texts and handbooks on agriculture, childbirth, pharmacy and medicine,
                   domestic economics, geography, divination, and Taoist rituals.</p>
